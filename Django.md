Django is a free and open-source, high-level Python web framework designed for rapid development of secure and maintainable websites. It follows the Model-Template-Views (MTV) architectural pattern, which is a variation of the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern. 
Key characteristics and features of Django:
Python-based:
Built entirely in Python, making it accessible to Python developers and leveraging Python's strengths.
High-level:
Handles much of the boilerplate code and common web development tasks, allowing developers to focus on application-specific logic.
Rapid Development:
Designed to accelerate development through its "Don't Repeat Yourself" (DRY) principle and built-in features.
Secure:
Includes built-in protections against common web vulnerabilities like SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and cross-site request forgery (CSRF).
Scalable:
Designed to handle increasing traffic and data loads, suitable for a wide range of applications.
Comprehensive:
Offers a rich set of features including an Object-Relational Mapper (ORM) for database interaction, a powerful templating engine, URL routing, authentication and authorization systems, and an administrative interface.
Active Community:
Supported by a large and active community, providing extensive documentation, forums, and resources.
Maintained by the Django Software Foundation (DSF):
An independent non-profit organization dedicated to supporting and advancing Django.
